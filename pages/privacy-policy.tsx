				<ul className="!list-disc">
					<li>
						Accordingly, a condition of each User’s use of and access to the
						Services is their acceptance of the Terms of Use, which also
						involves acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. Any User
						that does not agree with any provisions of the same has the option
						to discontinue the Services provided by HealthiFam immediately.
					</li>
					<li>
						An indicative list of information that HealthiFam may require you
						to provide to enable your use of the Services is provided in the
						Schedule annexed to this Privacy Policy.
					</li>
					<li>
						All the information provided to HealthiFam by a User, including
						sensitive personal information, is voluntary. You understand that
						HealthiFam may use certain information of yours, which has been
						designated as ‘sensitive personal data or information’ under the
						SPI Rules, (a) for the purpose of providing you the Services, (b)
						for commercial purposes and in an aggregated or non-personally
						identifiable form for research, statistical analysis and business

							<p>
								You hereby consent to such use of such information by
								HealthiFam.
							</p>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						iv. Collection of information which has been designated as
						‘sensitive personal data or information’ under the SPI Rules
						requires your express consent. By affirming your assent to this
						Privacy Policy, you provide your consent to such collection as
						required under applicable law. Our Services may be unavailable to
						you in the event such consent through an email is not given.
					</li>
					<li>
						HealthiFam does not control or endorse the content, messages or
						information found in any Services and, therefore, HealthiFam
						specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Services
						and any actions resulting from your participation in any Services,
						and you agree that you waive any claims against HealthiFam
						relating to same, and to the extent such waiver may be
						ineffective, you agree to release any claims against HealthiFam
						relating to same.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the
						information you submit to us, such as your contact information
						provided as part of account registration. If your personal
						information changes, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or
						amend information by making the change on our member information
						page or by contacting us through info@healthifam.com. We will make
						good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active
						databases as soon as reasonably practicable. If you provide any
						information that is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete
						(or becomes untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete), or
						HealthiFam has reasonable grounds to suspect that the information
						provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete,
						HealthiFam may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the provision
						of the Services to you.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may choose to unsubscribe from promotional communications that
						you receive from HealthiFam by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link
						provided at the end of every such promotional communication.

					<li>
						If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer
						use your information to provide you services, contact us through
						support@HealthiFam.com. We will retain your information for as
						long as your account with the Services is active and as needed to
						provide you the Services. We shall not retain such information for
						longer than is required for the purposes for which the information
						may lawfully be used or is otherwise required under any other law
						for the time being in force. After a period of time, your data may
						be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long
						as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our
						use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you wish to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications
						such as promotional and marketing-related information regarding
						the Services, please send us an email at support@ HealthiFam.com
					</li>
					<li>
						HealthiFam may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire
						transfer, debit card or cheque for Services for which subscription
						amount(s) is/are payable. HealthiFam will collect such User’s
						credit card number and/or other financial institution information
						such as bank account numbers and will use that information for the
						billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the
						use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to
						third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.
						Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished
						solely by the User through the authentication process. User’s
						credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of
						approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption,
						thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per
						current technology. However, HealthiFam provides you an option not
						to save your payment details. Users are advised, however, that
						internet technology is not full proof safe, and users should
						exercise discretion on using the same.
					</li>
					<li>
						Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User
						or the End-User or anyone who visits the Website, HealthiFam
						automatically receives the URL of the site from which anyone
						visits. HealthiFam also receives the Internet Protocol (IP)
						address of each User’s computer (or the proxy server a User used
						to access the World Wide Web), User’s computer operating system
						and type of web browser the User is using, email patterns, as well
						as the name of User’s ISP. This information is used to analyse
						overall trends to help HealthiFam improve its Service. The linkage
						between User’s IP address and User’s personally identifiable
						information is not shared with third parties. Notwithstanding the
						above, HealthiFam may share some of the aggregate findings (not
						the specific data) in anonymized form (i.e., non-personally
						identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic
						partners, and others in order to help grow its business.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Website uses temporary cookies to store certain data (that is

						browser. The cookies, however, do not store any personal
						information of the User.
					</li>
					<li>
						A User may have limited access to the Website and make
						appointments with the doctors without creating an account on the
						Website. Unregistered Users can make appointments with the doctors
						by providing their name and phone number. In order to have access

						create an account on our website. To create an account, a User is
						required to provide the following information, which such User
						recognizes and expressly acknowledges is personal information
						allowing others, including HealthiFam, to identify the User: name,
						User ID, email address, country, ZIP/postal code, age, phone
						number, password chosen by the User and valid financial account
						information. Other information requested on the registration page,
						including the ability to receive promotional offers from
						HealthiFam, is optional. HealthiFam may, in future, include other
						optional requests for information from the User to help HealthiFam
						to customize the Website to deliver personalized information to
						the User. However, HealthiFam assumes your consent in relation to
						various matters once you complete the registration process.
					</li>
					<li>
						This Privacy Policy applies to Services that are owned and
						operated by HealthiFam. HealthiFam does not exercise control over
						the sites displayed as search results or links from within its
						Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other
						files on the Users’ computer, collect data or solicit personal
						information from the Users, for which HealthiFam is not
						responsible or liable. Accordingly, HealthiFam does not make any
						representations concerning the privacy practices or policies of
						such third parties or terms of use of such websites, nor does
						HealthiFam guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of the
						information, data, text, software, sound, photographs, graphics,
						videos, messages, or other materials available on such websites.

						HealthiFam has implemented best international market practices and
						security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the
						personal data that it has under its control from unauthorised
						access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification and
						unlawful destruction or accidental loss. However, for any data
						loss or theft due to unauthorised access to the User’s electronic
						devices through which the User avails the Services, HealthiFam
						shall not be held liable for any loss whatsoever incurred by the
						User.
					</li>
					<li>
						HealthiFam implements reasonable security practices and procedures
						and has a comprehensive documented information security programme
						and information security policies that contain managerial,
						technical, operational, and physical security control measures

						more.

						than as specifically stated in this privacy Policy, will only
						disclose your personal information in the event it is required to
						do so by law, rule, regulation, law enforcement agency,
						governmental official, legal authority or similar requirements or

						have rights to use and disclose the personal information collected
						in connection with the provision of these Services in accordance
